# MEAM_5200_Final_Project_Pick_and_Place

Final project for MEAM 5200. Goal of project was to detect, grab, and stack static and dynamic blocks using a 7-DOF manipulator arm with a depth camera. Only main code in this repo, the rest of the code is ommited because the professor asks us to keep it private for future classes.
